# Python Intermediate Features

A comprehensive collection of Python intermediate concepts and examples, focusing on advanced language features like decorators and list comprehensions. This project serves as a learning resource and reference for Python developers looking to enhance their understanding of intermediate-level Python programming techniques.

## üéØ Project Purpose

This project demonstrates key intermediate Python concepts through practical, runnable examples. It's designed to help developers:
- Understand and implement Python decorators
- Master list comprehensions and functional programming patterns
- Learn best practices for intermediate Python development
- Have working examples to reference and experiment with

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Basic understanding of Python fundamentals (functions, classes, basic syntax)

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd 02-Intermediate
```

2. No external dependencies are required - this project uses only Python standard library features.

3. Verify your Python installation:
```bash
python --version
# or
python3 --version
```

## üìÅ Project Structure

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                 # This file - project documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ decorators.py            # Decorator examples and implementations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ list_comprehensions.py   # List comprehension examples
```

## üêç Running the Examples

### Decorators Example

Run the decorator demonstration:

```bash
python decorators.py
# or
python3 decorators.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Calling greet...
Hello, Pythonista!
greet finished.
```

### List Comprehensions Example

Run the list comprehension examples:

```bash
python list_comprehensions.py
# or
python3 list_comprehensions.py
```

## üìö File Descriptions

### `decorators.py`
This file demonstrates the concept of Python decorators through a practical example:

- **`log_function_call(func)`**: A decorator function that logs when a decorated function is called and when it finishes execution
- **`greet(name)`**: A simple function decorated with `@log_function_call` that demonstrates the decorator's functionality
- **Usage Example**: Shows how to apply the decorator and what the output looks like

**Key Learning Points:**
- How decorators wrap functions with additional functionality
- The `@` syntax for applying decorators
- Creating wrapper functions that can accept any arguments

### `list_comprehensions.py`
This file contains examples of Python list comprehensions:

- **Purpose**: Demonstrates concise and readable ways to create lists based on existing sequences
- **Benefits**: More readable than traditional for loops for simple list transformations
- **Use Cases**: Filtering, mapping, and transforming data in a single line

**Key Learning Points:**
- Syntax: `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`
- When to use list comprehensions vs. traditional loops
- Performance considerations and best practices

## üîß Customization

Feel free to modify these examples to experiment with different concepts:

- Add more decorator examples (timing, caching, validation)
- Create more complex list comprehensions
- Add error handling and edge cases
- Implement additional intermediate Python features

## üìñ Learning Resources
